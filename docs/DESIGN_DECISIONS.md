# Design Decisions for MOCA-Net

## Candidate Architectures Considered

### 1. Pure State-Space Model (SSM)
- **Approach**: Linear state-space dynamics with learned A, B, C, D matrices
- **Pros**: O(L) complexity, theoretically infinite context, stable gradients
- **Cons**: Limited expressiveness for complex patterns, no explicit memory mechanism
- **CPU Performance**: Excellent (fast matrix operations)

### 2. Lightweight Transformer
- **Approach**: Scaled-down attention with reduced head count and embedding dimensions
- **Pros**: Proven architecture, strong pattern recognition, interpretable attention
- **Cons**: O(L²) complexity, no external memory, parameter-heavy even when scaled down
- **CPU Performance**: Poor (quadratic scaling, memory-intensive)

### 3. MOCA-Net (Memory-Orchestrated Context Allocation Network) ⭐
- **Approach**: Hybrid architecture combining sparse routing, external memory, and lightweight experts
- **Pros**: 
  - O(L) complexity with sparse routing
  - Explicit memory for long-term storage
  - Budget-aware computation
  - Modular design for ablation studies
- **Cons**: More complex implementation, requires careful tuning of routing parameters
- **CPU Performance**: Good (sparse operations, configurable compute budget)

## Why MOCA-Net?

1. **Novelty**: Combines three powerful ideas (sparse MoE, external memory, budgeted routing) in a novel way
2. **Efficiency**: Sparse routing keeps compute linear while maintaining expressiveness
3. **Memory**: External memory bank provides explicit long-term storage without attention overhead
4. **Research Value**: Enables interesting ablation studies and opens new research directions
5. **CPU-Friendly**: Sparse operations and configurable compute budget make it suitable for CPU training

## Key Design Principles

- **Sparsity First**: Only activate necessary experts and memory slots per token
- **Budget Awareness**: Differentiable loss term encourages efficient resource usage
- **Modularity**: Easy to disable components for ablation studies
- **Stability**: LayerNorm, residual connections, and gradient clipping for reliable training
- **Interactive Ready**: Architecture designed for real-time inference and user interaction

## Interactive Inference Support

The MOCA-Net design decisions directly support interactive inference capabilities:

- **Sparse Routing**: Enables real-time text processing with O(L) complexity
- **External Memory**: Maintains context and improves prediction quality
- **Modular Design**: Allows easy testing and quality assurance
- **CPU-Friendly**: Sparse operations make it suitable for interactive use
